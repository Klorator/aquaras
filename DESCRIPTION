Title: Data processing related to MassLynx
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Rasmus Hammar
Maintainer: Rasmus Hammar <Rasmus.Hammar@gmx.com>
Description: Created primarily for personal use, all the better if anyone
    else finds this helpful.  Pre-LC/MS run: Provides tools for working
    with runlists to use with MassLynx (Waters LC/MS software).  Calling
    RunlistGenerator() launches a Shiny app that lets you create the full
    data frame and a runlist. Alternatively, create.Runlist() may be used
    directly.  Post-LC/MS run: Use splitOutput.ML() to split the MassLynx
    complete summary output file into individual data frames and write
    them to files.
