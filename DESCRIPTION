Title: Data processing related to MassLynx
Version: 0.1.4
Author: Rasmus Hammar
Maintainer: Rasmus Hammar <Rasmus.Hammar@gmx.com>
Description: I created aquaras to solve some specific tasks and have
    added/will add more functionality as the need arises. I would never
    have been able to make things work without all the amazing people who
    create and maintain the packages I've used. Thank you! - Pre-LC/MS
    run: Provides tools for working with runlists to use with MassLynx
    (Waters LC/MS software). - Post-LC/MS run: Split the MassLynx complete
    summary output file into individual data frames and write them to
    files. Unless clean = FALSE, this removes blanks and splits the "Name"
    and "Sample Name" columns according to the pre-LC/MS template. -
    ras.Randomizer() distributes compounds randomly to groups.
