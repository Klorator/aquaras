\title{Split MassLynx output file}
\usage{
SplitOutput.ML(sourceFile = file.choose(), clean = TRUE, write = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{sourceFile}{A file path}

\item{clean}{Defaults to TRUE for data cleaning}

\item{write}{Defaults to TRUE for writing to file system}
}
\value{
Writes a tsv file per compound to the same directory as the source file.

Also returns the list of data frames
}
\description{
Splits the MassLynx complete summary output file into individual data frames
based on compound.
\subsection{Uninteresting output}{

Spliting the file generates a stream of \code{"New names: â€¢ `` -> `...1`"}
output in the console that is not particularly interesting but lets you know
it's doing something.
}

\subsection{clean = TRUE}{

These data frames are cleaned by \code{\link[=cleanDF.ML]{cleanDF.ML()}} (unless clean = FALSE).
}

\subsection{write = TRUE}{

\strong{!!! DEFAULT IS TO WRITE TO FILE SYSTEM !!!} Data frames written to tsv files
in the same directory as the source file. Use write = FALSE to disable this.
}
}
\examples{
  \dontrun{
SplitOutput.ML() # First thing the function does is ask the user for a file.
SplitOutput.ML(clean = FALSE) # If the summary output file was not based on the provided template.
}

# !!! DOES **NOT** WRITE TO FILE SYSTEM !!!
